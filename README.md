# SQLBookstoreDB
Bookstore database project created in SQL
Working with a Docker container in Azure data studio, I created an mssql database to store information relating to a fictional bookstore, including book titles, author names, author ID numbers, and inventory counts. I used ChatGPT to assign tasks at random, such as updating book prices, decreasing inventory stock counts after book sales, and creating a section for bargain priced books. I performed tasks through SQL queries that include joins, stored procedures, and more.
